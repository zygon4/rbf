Dependencies:

This project uses leiningen.  It depends on Incanter.




Note that the results have horrible, horrible axis labels.  This is due to some Incanter issue.  The plots 
are essentially the error rate as more training samples are provided.  Some plots have scattered training
data making the squirrelly error curves and some have evenly spaced training data making smooth, sexy error
curves.
